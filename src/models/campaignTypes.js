 * Contains types of campaigns.
 *
 * All types should have a meaningful "name" property and a brief "description" property
 *
 * Each type may have "requirement" function that calculates if the requirement is met.
 * If humans are needed (to answer a question), the "question" attribute should be specified
 *
 * Parameters to the requirement function: values (supplied from database), user, purchase, customerData (of the current business)
